LearnSAT is a Prolog program for learning about SAT solving. It
implements the classic Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm,
together will modern extensions of the algorithm: conflict-driven clause
learning (CDCL), non-chronological backtracking (NCB) and lookahead.

## Community guidelines

Thank you for your interest in LearnSAT.

This is my first Open Source / GitHub project, so there may be some glitches until I have more experience!

For now, the guidelines are:

- If you wish to modify the Prolog source code, please fork the project and leave the master branch with my source code.
- If you have additional SAT examples or tutorial material that you want to add, I can include them in the master branch. Open an issue and / or contact me directly at [moti.ben.ari@gmail.com](mailto:moti.ben.ari@gmail.com).
